# Javascript Scratchpad    

This repo is a playground/sandbox to explore the javascript language, web apis, and nodejs.  

`isomorphic/` is for general js language stuff - stuff that works in either browser or server runtimes.

`browser/` is for javascript that would only work in a browser runtime (web apis, things that require `window`, etc.)

`nodejs/` is for javascript that would only work in a server runtime.  Whether that means server-specific code, or just the bundled-js for frontend way of doing things.
